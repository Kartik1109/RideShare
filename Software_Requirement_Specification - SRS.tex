1 Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Specification is to maintain a reference towards the project goals, constraints,
and requirements. This ensures that all ambiguity within the project is eliminated, and that all
crucial requirements of the project are clearly documented. The specification will be consistently
referenced throughout the project, and forms the basis on which the final product will be built. The
intended audience of the SRS is for the developers of the product to reference, as well as the client
to approve.
1.2 Scope
The name of this product will be “Ridelink”. The software will provide a service to customers
of the taxi company, allowing them to conveniently set up and join carpools. Users will be able
to offer to carpool from their taxi, or join a carpool heading to the same destination. This allows
users to save money on taxi fares and the taxi company to save time and fuel, and attract more
customers. This app also offers users the opportunity to participate in a fun ”Wordle Wednesday”
challenge, where they will be rewarded with a discounted fare for entering the word of the day each
Wednesday.

2 Overall Product Description
2.1 Product Perspective
This product provides a carpooling service, similar to other products on the market, such as
P oparide2 which allows drivers to find carpoolers to cover gas costs. However, our service differs in
that it is specifically designed for taxi companies to use. Thus, it contains other important features,
such as passenger rating, and a dispatcher to store information of all registered taxis in our client
company. This product is not totally independent. It relies on the google maps API to determine
routes and it exists as part of a service provided by the client taxi service.

2.2 Product Functions
• Match Facilitation: The purpose of this application is to facilitate matches amongst people
who are using the taxi service, and are heading to similar destinations. The goal of this
application is for the users to share the taxis, allowing them to save money by splitting the fare.
This will be accomplished through a main ”Dispatcher” that creates matches in accordance to
provided information.
• Application Modes: The application offers a “Request Taxi Carpool” mode and an “Offer
Taxi Carpool” mode.
– The ”Request Taxi Carpool” mode shall provide the customer with the ability to specify
their destination and other search criteria and send the input to the dispatcher to find
matches. Upon the customer making a selection, the system shall notify the ”Dispatcher”
to forward the request to the offering rider.
– The ”Offer Taxi Carpool” mode shall provide customers with the feature to scan a code
representing the taxi ID, which would be placed inside the taxi. After scanning the code,
the customer must enter details about their offer, such as destination, taxi ID, and the
maximum number of customers to share the ride with. The offer will be sent to the
”Dispatcher” for processing. The customer must wait for requests after making the offer.
• Creative Feature: The application provides discount to Wordle Wednesday winners.
2.3 User Characteristics
This application provides a simple matching service, to allow taxi users to save money by splitting
taxi fares. It is targeted for the regular client base of the taxi company, including students, adults,
3
and seniors. The app is also designed in accordance of
Educational Level: To use the app as such there is no specific level of education required. A
basic understanding of smartphones and other technologies, however, might be useful.
Experience: The users of the app don’t necessarily need to have prior experience of traveling in
a taxi - they can be traveling for the first time or be a frequent user.
Technical expertise: Experience using a smartphone/smartphone application
2.4 Constraints
The cost to create the application shall be within the developing team’s budget. In the case of
our team, the application must be achievable with no initial investments.
The timeframe for the development of the application is until the week of April 10.
The fares must be calculated such that the taxi company profits while the taxi riders save from
carpooling.
The fares must follow the method of taxi-fare calculation in accordance to the bylaws of the city
it operates in. Additionally, the fares must include appropriate taxes (13% in Toronto).
2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
The following system properties are assumed, and changes to these assumptions will accordingly
change the system requirements:
The system will be built as a native application for the android operating system, specifically
targeting typical modern smartphones (i.e. pocket-sized mobile devices with single screens, camera,
and GPS capabilities). The system also depends on the continued support and open access of the
map-providing service used (i.e. Google maps API) as this would be required for allow customers
to track the taxi route and present potential routes when requesting or offering taxi carpools.

3 Use Case Diagram
This is an example of the standard procedure of requesting to join a carpool. It requires the
requester to choose their option, as well as the offer maker to accept. The app must handle this
by authenticating the users and maintaining a line of communication between each user, as well as
updating the databases for changes to carpool availability.

5.3.7 Scalability or Extensibility Requirements
PR-SE1. The application must be extendable for use with other taxi companies. Therefore,
there has to be minimal coupling between the application and the individual taxi company.
The application must be a stand-alone entity, separated from the taxi company.
Rationale: In order for the application to be useful, a high number of users must be using it.
Therefore, it is important for the application to be extensible such that many different taxi
companies in different regions can
5.3.8 Longevity Requirements
PR-L1. The application should be manually monitored on the first Monday of every month to
ensure that fare calculations are up to date with the average costs of taxis.
Rationale: The application’s fare calculations are subject to change based on the pricing of

features to enable the core functionality of the app.
5.5.3 Adaptability Requirements
MS-A1. The application’s UI should scale correctly to fit devices with different aspect ratios.
The height and width of the application should be within 0.3 inches of the borders of the phone
that it is operating on.
